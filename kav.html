  <h1>EXPERIENCE THE SUMMIT</h1>

      <h5 class="card-title">Academic Excellence</h5>
      <p class="card-text">The difference between ordinary and extraordinary is that little ‘extra’. Almost all the top schools vie for academic honours and lay great stress on results. While good results have always been a priority what makes HPS special is the fact that students are taught to leave a blazing trail where once there lay a beaten path – to do ordinary things in an extraordinary fashion. That is why probably HPS has down the ages managed to produce many high profile achievers who have done the alma-mater proud. Pupils are taught to soar high and told that while some may succeed because they are destined to most succeed because they are determined to.</p>

<p>Education is akin to an apple tree, though the roots are bitter, the fruit is sweet, but at HPS, even the roots of the tree – ‘the learning process’ is sweet.</p>

      <h5 class="card-title">Sports</h5>
      <p class="card-text">At SKEI Khammam, we focus on physical fitness of our students as well as their skills and levels of competency. We encourage our students to remain physically fit, as a sound mind can only be housed in a sound body. They are assessed for their strength, endurance, flexibility, speed and coordination.</p>

<p>SKEI has made sports an integral part of the school curriculum, making it compulsory for every student to be a part of the school’s sports routine. Physical Education as a subject has been introduced in the year 2006, for Classes 9 to 12. The Boarders get an energetic start to their day with vigorous PT every morning.</p>

      <h5 class="card-title">Performing & Visual</h5>
      <p class="card-text">Multi-faceted learning has become the need of the hour. Students are storehouses of creativity and raw talent that waits to be tapped. SKEI endeavours to provide its students with a conducive environment which caters to the holistic development of the child’s personality. A wide array of co-curricular activities are made available for the students to choose from. They are encouraged to opt for such activities that bring out their innate artistry. Besides, these activities act as stress busters giving students an opportunity to release pent up emotions.</p>

<p>They teach children to be compassionate. Students discover themselves, get to know their strengths, imbibe the value of teamwork, have fun, make new friends, as well as learn new skills. SKEI nurtures its budding geniuses, shaping them and giving them wings to fly. It equips them to soar and scale those heights that await those who dare.</p>
